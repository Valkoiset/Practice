### Section 3
## 7. Credentials & First Instance
# had to add -chdir argument because in course it was shown just like terraform init first_instance/
# so seems like syntax has changed a bit
# being in root folder run:
terraform -chdir=first_instance init
terraform -chdir=first_instance plan
terraform -chdir=first_instance apply
terraform -chdir=first_instance destroy
